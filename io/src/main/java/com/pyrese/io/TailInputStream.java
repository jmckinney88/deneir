     * <p> This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is

     * <p>
     * <p> If <code>len</code> is zero, then no bytes are read and
     * <code>0</code> is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
     * least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
     * file, the value <code>-1</code> is returned; otherwise, at least one
     * byte is read and stored into <code>b</code>.
     * <p>
     * <p> The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[off]</code>, the
     * next one into <code>b[off+1]</code>, and so on. The number of bytes read
     * is, at most, equal to <code>len</code>. Let <i>k</i> be the number of
     * bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements
     * <code>b[off]</code> through <code>b[off+</code><i>k</i><code>-1]</code>,

     * <p> In every case, elements <code>b[0]</code> through

     * <p>
     * <p> The <code>read(b,</code> <code>off,</code> <code>len)</code> method
     * for class <code>InputStream</code> simply calls the method
     * <code>read()</code> repeatedly. If the first such call results in an

     * any subsequent call to <code>read()</code> results in a
     * <code>IOException</code>, the exception is caught and treated as if it
     * were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into
     * <code>b</code> and the number of bytes read before the exception
     * occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks
     * until the requested amount of input data <code>len</code> has been read,
     * end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are encouraged
     * to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
